index.html:

1) fa fa-times (line 26) - Font Awesome, Icon Collection, times is "x" for close button
2) section tag (line 29) - part of HTML5, should be used for more specific applications than div, when it's contents
      can be considered a different section of the site.
3) file hierarchy/file variable names
4) class checkbox (line 65) - I think this is part of the bootstrap form. On bootstrap's website: 

    <div class="checkbox">
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox"> Check me out
        </label>
    </div>
    
    perhaps our input tag should be included inside of our label tag like thier example?
    
5) password (line 90) - What was the question about this? This appears to be bootstrap as well.
6) modal_trigger (line 110)
7) leanModal (line 110)

I think there are some redundancies in the libaries that are included.  We should clean that up, as well.
